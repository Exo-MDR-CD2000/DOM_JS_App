# DOM_JS_App
Add songs to playlist via DOM manipulation using JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap.

## Description

The goal was to create a simple page that demonstrated DOM manipulation by following these requirements:

1. A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
2. A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when clicking on submit.

Most of the Bootstrap code was lifted from a previous project such as the navbar, footer, and general table body. The HTML was created first using Bootstrap properties. The forms were created that would eventually allow a user to add a song entry to some table data below it. A seperate JavaScript file was made to contain all the functionality needed to manipulate the DOM for form submission and the table data. Local storage functionality was also added for deletion of songs but was not needed for the project requirements.
